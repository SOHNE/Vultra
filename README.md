## Introduction

`Vultra` aims to empower you to build and prototype games and vulkan apps quickly. It is a lightweight rendering library written in C99, drawing inspiration from the simplicity of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and the robustness of [liblava](https://github.com/liblava/liblava). Originally a study project, the focus is on keeping the code clear, simple, and easy to work with.

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> `Vultra` is currently in a highly work-in-progress state. The API is unstable and subject to significant changes. It is intended for learning and experimentation purposes.

To get started with, here's a simple example that demonstrates the basics:

```c
#include "vultra/vultra.h"

int
main( void )
{
    const int screenWidth  = 640;
    const int screenHeight = 480;

    InitWindow( screenWidth, screenHeight, "Vultra: Basic Window" );
    SetTargetFPS( 60 );

    while( !ShouldQuit() )
        {
            if( IsKeyDown( KEY_ESCAPE ) ) break;

            BeginDrawing();
            {
                // ...
            }
            EndDrawing();
        }

    CloseWindow();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Build & Run

##### CPM.cmake

1. First, set up [CPM.cmake] in your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p cmake
   wget -O cmake/CPM.cmake https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/releases/latest/download/get_cpm.cmake
   ```

2. In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add the following lines after `project(...)`:

   ```cmake
   include(cmake/CPM.cmake)

   CPMAddPackage("gh:SOHNE/Vultra@25.0.0")

   add_executable(your_target main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Vultra::Vultra)
